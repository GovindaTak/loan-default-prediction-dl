# **Loan Default Prediction with Deep Learning**  

## **Overview**  
This project applies deep learning techniques to predict whether a borrower will repay their loan or default. Using a subset of the LendingClub dataset, the model leverages a fully connected neural network to analyze historical loan data and classify borrower behavior.

## **Features**  
- **Data Preprocessing**:  
  - Handled missing values and performed feature scaling.  
  - Engineered features to enhance model input quality.  

- **Neural Network Architecture**:  
  - Built a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) for binary classification.  
  - Experimented with hyperparameters to optimize model performance.  

- **Model Evaluation**:  
  - Evaluated the model using metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score.  

- **Visualization**:  
  - Visualized training and validation loss curves.  
  - Analyzed the confusion matrix to understand model predictions.
